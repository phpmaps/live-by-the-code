#ArcGIS API for JavaScript CSS Code to Stylize the Attribution Widget within a Web Map

Shows the CSS code to adjust the appearance of the attribution in a Web Map (sometimes referred to as data credits) found in the 
bottom right corner of the map.  Stylizing Web Map attribution is a bit different from stylizing a classic map object
with layers.  The key concept to understand is that a Web Map will likely appear after the page loads and 
as a result when using classic CSS the target element (aka the Attribute Widget element) will not be on the page.  
Therefore before applying a style, it's important to wait until the Web Map is on the page.
